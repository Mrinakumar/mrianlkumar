Hello! My name is Mrinal Kumar, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from GL Bajaj Institute of Technology.

I kick-started my career with an internship at Geekster, where I refined my technical skills and gained practical experience. This journey enabled me to tackle new challenges and find innovative solutions.

Currently, I am immersed in a Java OOPs project - developing an ATM Machine using Classes and Objects. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in Java but also my ability to design robust and user-friendly software.

I'm proud to have completed over 250 technical questions in English on HackerRank, which has significantly enhanced my knowledge and problem-solving skills.

I'm committed to continuous personal and professional growth, always seeking new opportunities and fresh challenges. I believe in the power of collaboration and networking to expand knowledge and experiences.

If you're interested in connecting or collaborating, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn. Thank you!"
